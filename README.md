# TMExplainer

TMExplainer is a prototype interpretability framework under active development that deciphers the drivers behind drug response predictions. It integrates diverse inputs—including genomics, omics, whole slide images, and clinical variables—to reveal key biological mechanisms.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Method Approach:**  
  Combines GraphMask, SHAP scores, attention matrix analysis, and sparse autoencoders to identify influential genes, pathways, and cellular processes.

- **TME-Specific Insights:**  
  Adapts to tumor microenvironment data by generating spatial heatmaps that pinpoint critical histopathological regions and assess how clinical factors (age, gender, ethnicity) interact with molecular features.

- **Robust Evaluation:**  
  Benchmarks interpretability using fidelity, sparsity, and faithfulness metrics, with validation against established literature.

## Overview

TMExplainer provides transparent insights into model predictions, facilitating hypothesis generation and guiding experimental validation. As a prototype, it is evolving to better support precision oncology through enhanced interpretability.
